                <p class="paragraf-about text-justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Adidas AG, headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany, stands as a giant in the athletic apparel and footwear industry. Renowned for its iconic three stripes, Adidas boasts the title of the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe and the second largest globally, trailing only behind Nike.

                <img class="small-img" src="./image copy.png"/>
                <p class="paragraf-history text-justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The company was founded by Adolf "Adi" Dassler who made sports shoes in his mother's scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach, Germany after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older brother Rudolf joined the business, which became "Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory" (Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik). The electricity supply in Herzogenaurach was unreliable, so the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.</p>
                <p class="paragraf-history text-justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. In 1936, Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his hand made spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Following Owens' four gold medals, the name and reputation of Dassler shoes became known to the world's sportsmen and their trainers. Business was successful and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes every year before World War II.</p>
                <p class="paragraf-history text-justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Both Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in May 1933 and became members of the National Socialist Motor Corps. Adolf took the rank of Sportwart in the Hitler Youth from 1935 until the end of the war. During the war, the company was running the last sport shoe factory in Germany and predominantly supplied the Wehrmacht with shoes. In 1943, their shoe production was forced to cease operations and the company's facilities and workforce was used to manufacture anti-tank weapons. From 1942 to 1945, at least nine forced labourers were working at both sites of the company. </p>
                <p class="paragraf-history text-justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp;The Dassler factory, used for production of anti-tank weapons during World War II, was nearly destroyed in 1945 by US forces. It was spared when Adolf Dassler's wife convinced the American soldiers that the company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports shoes. American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of the Dassler brothers' shoes. </p>

                <h3 class="paragraf-about-heading heading-history">Split and rivalry with Puma</h3>
                <p class="paragraf-history text-justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brothers split up in 1947 after relations between them had broken down,] with Adolf forming a company registered as Adidas AG, from Adi Dassler, on 18 August 1949, and Rudolf forming a new firm that he called Ruda – from Rudolf Dassler, later rebranded Puma. Urban myths have popularised two backronyms for the name "Adidas": All Day I Dream About Sports.</p>

                    <li>In 1998, Adidas sued the NCAA over their rules limiting the size and number of commercial logos on team uniforms and team clothing</li>

                    <li>In 2003, Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness World Trading's use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas's three stripes. The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark, Fitness World's use was infringing because the public could establish a link between that use and Adidas's mark. </li>
                    <li>In September 2004, English fashion designer Stella McCartney launched a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation. This line is a sports performance collection for women called "Adidas by Stella McCartney".</li>
                    <li>In November 2011, Adidas announced that it would acquire outdoor action sport performance brand Five Ten through a share purchase agreement. The total purchase price was US$25 million in cash at closing. </li>
